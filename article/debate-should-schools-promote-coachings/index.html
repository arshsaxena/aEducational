                                Good morning to one and all present here! Today, I, Arsh Saxena, student of class XI, would like to speak against the notion “Should school promote coaching institutes?”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Education gives a person skills to have a bright future, so everyone is quite serious about educating themselves. But the fact that education can be gained easily by joining coaching institutes is completely wrong. The craze of joining coaching institutes can be seen in students. Due to this, many new coaching institutes are being opened. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The point of schools promoting coaching institutes is very unethical and irrelevant. Schools promoting coaching institutes sound ridiculous as schools themselves are instituted for giving education. Moreover, these institutes don’t have experienced teachers and the speed at which the syllabus is completed is quite fast.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CBSE has also issued guidelines on this practice. According to CBSE, conducting coaching classes in school premises for entrance exams or boards is restricted. Strict action may be taken against the culprit schools. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Schools instead of promoting coaching institutes should improve their ways of teaching.
                            </p>
