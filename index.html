                                        Good morning to one and all present here. Today, I, Arsh Saxena, student of class XI, would like to tell you something about the National Education Policy 2020.
    
                                        Education plays an important role in the development of a nation. As we are facing a major change in terms of knowledge around the world, the Government of India has approved National Education Policy 2020. This policy will replace 34 years old National Education Policy 1986....

                                        Good morning to one and all present here! Today, I, Arsh Saxena, student of class XI, would like to present my views against the notion “Should school promote coaching institutes?”.
                                        Education gives a person skills to have a bright future, so everyone is quite serious about educating themselves. But the fact that education can be gained easily by joining coaching institutes is completely wrong. The craze of joining coaching institutes can be seen in students. Due to this, many new coaching institutes are being opened.

                                        Good morning, everyone! Today, I am going to expatiate on the benefits of regular practice of yoga.
    
                                        Yoga is the most miscomprehended and misunderstood concept only in India but also throughout the world. The word ‘yoga’ conjures up the images of ascetics, or yoga gurus doing arduous physical postures or asanas! Only blending, stretching, moving, etc. of various body parts in an association of certain breathing exercises is not the totality of yoga.

                                        Cleanliness is the state or quality of being clean or being kept clean. Everyone needs to learn about cleanliness, hygiene, sanitation, and the various diseases that are caused due to poor hygienic conditions. It is crucial for physical well-being and maintaining a healthy environment at home and school. An unclean environment is an invitation for many mosquitoes to breed in and spread deadly diseases. On the other hand, not maintaining personal hygiene leads to many skin problems and decreased immunity.
