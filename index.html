                                    Education plays an important role in the development of a nation. As we are facing a major change in terms of knowledge around the world, the Government of India has approved National Education Policy 2020.

                                    Good morning to one and all present here! Today, I, Arsh Saxena, student of class XI, would like to present my views against the notion “Should school promote coaching institutes?”.

                                    Education gives a person skills to have a bright future, so everyone is quite serious about educating themselves. But the fact that education can be gained easily by joining coaching institutes is completely wrong. The craze of joining coaching institutes can be seen in students. Due to this, many new coaching institutes are being opened.

                                    It is said that “student life is golden life” because student life is the most important part of human life. It is the period of pure joy and happiness because the mind of a student free from all cares and worries of grown-up life. In this period, the character of a child is built. So, it is also called the formative period of human life. Every student should his/her best to make good use of student life.
